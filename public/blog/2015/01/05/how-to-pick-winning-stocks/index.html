<div class="entry-content"><!-- Our best advice for anyone who asks that question is to stop and educate themselves before they throw away their money. These days, there are a ton of investment vehicles that are well suited for retail investors, such as ETFs, Index/Mutual Funds, and the more modern roboadvisors, like Wealthfront and Betterment. However, you want to retain control and understand where you money is going, stocks will always be a sensible choice. While  "stock picking" is inherently risky, there are many methods to reduce this risk and maximize your chances of growing your portfolio. -->


<p>One of the most frequent questions we get emailed is &ldquo;how does Cappio work?&rdquo; What powers Cappio is not some Wall Street wizardry, it&rsquo;s tried and true methodology using fundamental analysis. As a quick refresher, fundamental analysis is the process of researching a company based on what they do, how they make money, and it&rsquo;s financial data.</p>

<p>Usually this is a process that can take a couple hours, if not days for a novice. Luckily, an accounting professor by the name of Joseph Piotroski at the University of Chicago formalized many fundamental metrics that should be used when evaluating a company. Weâ€™ve added a few comparative metrics to the Cappio algorithm to make it more comphrensive and computational. Below is a video summarizing the methodology we will go over in this post:</p>

<h1>Breaking it Down</h1>

<p>Determining if a company is financially stable can seem subjective and daunting. Cappio breaks down the financial data into four domains to help analysze the company from the top down:</p>

<h3>Industry</h3>

<p>A healthy company should be growing faster and capturing the market it is in. To get a general idea, we can take a look at some common ratios and compare the company to industry averages.</p>

<p><img src="http://note.io/1yummND"></p>

<p>If you need a refresher on any of these terms, Cappio has easy to understand tooltips for every one of these metrics. You can read them by hovering over the terms you are confused about in the app.</p>

<h3>Valuation</h3>

<p>Similar to the Industry section, Valuation helps compare a company to it&rsquo;s top three competitors. Also like in the Industry section you can find explanations of the terms by highlighting them in the app. Generally, the first seven metrics should be higher than competitors and the last three should be lower.</p>

<p><img src="http://note.io/14fzjO7"></p>

<h3>Fundamentals</h3>

<p>The fundamentals of a company involve diving into three major financial statements, the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. These three are used in tandem to find out if the company is making and retaining money.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uimblUe.png"></p>

<p>Some specific metrics to look out for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the revenue growing?</li>
<li>Is the net income growing?</li>
<li>Is the current ratio (a measure of how able they are to pay off short term debt) not too far over 1.0?</li>
<li>Is the free cash flow (money in the bank) increasing?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Management Effectiveness and Profitability</h3>

<p>As a rule of thumb, you can gauge a company&rsquo;s management effectiveness by taking a look at the Return on Assets (RoA) and Return on Equity (RoE.) It&rsquo;s always a good sign to see them both increasing compared to the previous year and in well-ranked among its competitors.</p>

<p>To get an idea of the company&rsquo;s profitability, take a look at the Operating and Profit Margins to make sure they are positive and increasing.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/j7hk2kE.png"></p>

<h3>Bringing It All Together</h3>

<p>As an overview, this methodology helps you get a good idea of how a potential investment stands against it&rsquo;s industry, competitors, and past performance. It may not be the most fun thing to do but you can cover a lot of bases and reduce your risk if you following simple checklists like these. I&rsquo;d also like to note that always helps to look at an investment holistically. Evaluating growth is subjective and the answer can&rsquo;t be found in just numbers. This is where where keeping up with current events and formulating your own opinions comes into play.</p>

<p>Keep in mind there&rsquo;s no company that is going to fulfill every criteria. However, a company that meets most of them is a solid investment. The reason is simple - a fundamentally strong company is making money and growing. As a company grows, so does the value of the company and therefore, the stock price increases over time.</p>
