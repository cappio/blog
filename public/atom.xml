    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<!-- Our best advice for anyone who asks that question is to stop and educate themselves before they throw away their money. These days, there are a ton of investment vehicles that are well suited for retail investors, such as ETFs, Index/Mutual Funds, and the more modern roboadvisors, like Wealthfront and Betterment. However, you want to retain control and understand where you money is going, stocks will always be a sensible choice. While  "stock picking" is inherently risky, there are many methods to reduce this risk and maximize your chances of growing your portfolio. -->


<p>One of the most frequent questions we get emailed is &ldquo;how does Cappio work?&rdquo; What powers Cappio is not some Wall Street wizardry, it&rsquo;s tried and true methodology using fundamental analysis. As a quick refresher, fundamental analysis is the process of researching a company based on what they do, how they make money, and it&rsquo;s financial data.</p>

<p>Usually this is a process that can take a couple hours, if not days for a novice. Luckily, an accounting professor by the name of Joseph Piotroski at the University of Chicago formalized many fundamental metrics that should be used when evaluating a company. We’ve added a few comparative metrics to the Cappio algorithm to make it more comphrensive and computational. Below is a video summarizing the methodology we will go over in this post:</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/bDedohLsEwo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


<h1>Breaking it Down</h1>

<p>Determining if a company is financially stable can seem subjective and daunting. Cappio breaks down the financial data into four domains to help analysze the company from the top down:</p>

<h3>Industry</h3>

<p>A healthy company should be growing faster and capturing the market it is in. To get a general idea, we can take a look at some common ratios and compare the company to industry averages.</p>

<p><img src="http://note.io/1yummND"></p>

<p>If you need a refresher on any of these terms, Cappio has easy to understand tooltips for every one of these metrics. You can read them by hovering over the terms you are confused about in the app.</p>

<h3>Valuation</h3>

<p>Similar to the Industry section, Valuation helps compare a company to it&rsquo;s top three competitors. Also like in the Industry section you can find explanations of the terms by highlighting them in the app. Generally, the first seven metrics should be higher than competitors and the last three should be lower.</p>

<p><img src="http://note.io/14fzjO7"></p>

<h3>Fundamentals</h3>

<p>The fundamentals of a company involve diving into three major financial statements, the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. These three are used in tandem to find out if the company is making and retaining money.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uimblUe.png"></p>

<p>Some specific metrics to look out for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the revenue growing?</li>
<li>Is the net income growing?</li>
<li>Is the current ratio (a measure of how able they are to pay off short term debt) not too far over 1.0?</li>
<li>Is the free cash flow (money in the bank) increasing?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Management Effectiveness and Profitability</h3>

<p>As a rule of thumb, you can gauge a company&rsquo;s management effectiveness by taking a look at the Return on Assets (RoA) and Return on Equity (RoE.) It&rsquo;s always a good sign to see them both increasing compared to the previous year and in well-ranked among its competitors.</p>

<p>To get an idea of the company&rsquo;s profitability, take a look at th Operating and Profit Margins to make sure they are positive and increasing.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/j7hk2kE.png"></p>

<h3>Bringing It All Together</h3>

<p>As an overview, this methodology helps you get a good idea of how a potential investment stands against it&rsquo;s industry, competitors, and past performance. It may not be the most fun thing to do but you can cover a lot of bases and reduce your risk if you following simple checklists like these. I&rsquo;d also like to note that always helps to look at an investment holistically. Evaluating growth is subjective and the answer can&rsquo;t be found in just numbers. This is where where keeping up with current events and formulating your own opinions comes into play.</p>

<p>Keep in mind there&rsquo;s no company that is going to fulfill every criteria. However, a company that meets most of them is a solid investment. The reason is simple - a fundamentally strong company is making money and growing. As a company grows, so does the value of the company and therefore, the stock price increases over time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You don’t need an economist to tell you oil prices are tanking. Anyone who’s visited the pump recently already has all the evidence they need. However, why oil prices are falling is a much more puzzling. Like any macroeconomic trend, the causes are a combination of political and legal factors. The Economist boils it down to four major factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Demand is low because of weak economic activity, increased efficiency, and movement towards oil alternatives.</li>
<li>Turmoil in Iraq and Libya, two big oil producers, has not affected their exporting.</li>
<li>America has become the world’s largest oil producer. Though it does not export crude oil, it now imports much less, creating a lot of spare supply.</li>
<li>The Saudis and their Gulf allies have decided not to sacrifice their own market share to restore the price. They can afford to do so since their margins are much higher than countries they detest such as Iran and Russia.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Do these current prices uncover investment opportunities?</h2>

<p>Let’s take a look at four fundamentally sound companies that relate to the current oil prices.</p>

<h3>Global Partners LP (NYSE: GLP)</h3>

<p>Global Partners LP is one of the largest wholesale distributors of gasoline, home heating oil, and residual oil to wholesalers, retailers and commercial customers in New England and New York. They also have a network of approximately 1,000 independent owners, suppliers and operators of gasoline stations in the Northeast.</p>

<p>They are currently nearing their 52 week low of $32.77 but have been putting up completely solid numbers. Seems like they are oversold and would be a great company to look more into. <a href="http://www.capp.io/queries/new?query=GLP">Check out the Cappio report here</a> for more details on it’s fundamentals.</p>

<h3>Schlumberger Limited (NYSE: SLB)</h3>

<p>Schlumberger Limited is an oilfield services company that supplies technology, integrated project management, and information solutions to oil and gas exploration and production. With the prices at they are right now, oil producers need Schlumberger technology to increase production and margins. Schlumberger&rsquo;s financials show amazing stability. You can see the solid numbers from <a href="http://www.capp.io/queries/new?query=SLB">their Cappio report</a></p>

<h3>Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM)</h3>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corporation explores and produces for crude oil and natural gas. It is considered a safe play way to directly invest in a potential oil rebound because they produce oil and natural gas at a 50/50 ratio. Exxon has historically been accused of it’s large exposure to natural gas, which has greatly lagged the price of crude oil in the last six years. With the recent dip in price this split is now positive. It also explains why the stock of Exxon has lost only 10% of its value in the last five months, while Chevron has lost 17% and BP has lost 19%. <a href="http://www.capp.io/queries/new?query=xom">Check the Cappio report here</a></p>

<h3>Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL)</h3>

<p>Fuel makes up a third of airlines’ operating costs. According to the Air Transportation Association (ATA), fuel is an airline&rsquo;s second largest expense. With these prices falling their margins are increased substantially. <a href="http://www.capp.io/queries/new?query=dal">Here are some of solid fundamentals they are showing on their Cappio report</a></p>

Finance - Why Airline Stocks Should Keep Soaring</a></p>

<h2>Where are prices headed?</h2>

<p>The general consensus is that the current oil oversupply is economically unsustainable for producers who are not in the Gulf. These producers rely on shale, tar sands, and deep sea oil, which are much more expensive to produce. Eventually, they will need government intervention or will be squeezed out of their market share.</p>

<p>However, it’s impossible to time the market so accurately predicting where oil prices is impractical. OPEC, which produces about 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s crude oil, has been very passive about cutting supply to raise prices. There are claims that they won’t budge on supply if the price drops down to $40.</p>

<p>Luckily the world is no longer solely dependant on OPEC for oil. Russia, America and others are also huge players in the market that have influence on prices. For further information on how the geopolicitcal landscape could quickly cause a rebound in prices, <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/three-scenarios-that-result-in-a-rebound-for-oil-2014-12-15">reference MarketWatch&rsquo;s article</a></p>
