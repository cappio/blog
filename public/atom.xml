    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You don’t need an economist to tell you oil prices are tanking. Anyone who’s visited the pump recently already has all the evidence they need. However, why oil prices are falling is a much more puzzling. Like any macroeconomic trend, the causes are a combination of political and legal factors. The Economist boils it down to four major factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Demand is low because of weak economic activity, increased efficiency, and movement towards oil alternatives.</li>
<li>Turmoil in Iraq and Libya, two big oil producers, has not affected their exporting.</li>
<li>America has become the world’s largest oil producer. Though it does not export crude oil, it now imports much less, creating a lot of spare supply.</li>
<li>The Saudis and their Gulf allies have decided not to sacrifice their own market share to restore the price. They can afford to do so since their margins are much higher than countries they detest such as Iran and Russia.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Do these current prices uncover investment opportunities?</h2>

<p>Let’s take a look at four fundamentally sound companies that relate to the current oil prices.</p>

<h3>Global Partners LP (NYSE: GLP)</h3>

<p>Global Partners LP is one of the largest wholesale distributors of gasoline, home heating oil, and residual oil to wholesalers, retailers and commercial customers in New England and New York. They also have a network of approximately 1,000 independent owners, suppliers and operators of gasoline stations in the Northeast.</p>

<p>They are currently nearing their 52 week low of $32.77 but have been putting up completely solid numbers. Seems like they are oversold and would be a great company to look more into. <a href="http://www.capp.io/queries/new?query=GLP">Check out the Cappio report here</a> for more details on it’s fundamentals.</p>

<h3>Schlumberger Limited (NYSE: SLB)</h3>

<p>Schlumberger Limited is an oilfield services company that supplies technology, integrated project management, and information solutions to oil and gas exploration and production. With the prices at they are right now, oil producers need Schlumberger technology to increase production and margins. Schlumberger&rsquo;s financials show amazing stability.

<h3>Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM)</h3>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corporation explores and produces for crude oil and natural gas. It is considered a safe play way to directly invest in a potential oil rebound because they produce oil and natural gas at a 50/50 ratio. Exxon has historically been accused of it’s large exposure to natural gas, which has greatly lagged the price of crude oil in the last six years. With the recent dip in price this split is now positive. It also explains why the stock of Exxon has lost only 10% of its value in the last five months, while Chevron has lost 17% and BP has lost 19%. <a href="http://www.capp.io/queries/new?query=xom">Check the Cappio report here</a></p>

<h3>Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL)</h3>

<p>Fuel makes up a third of airlines’ operating costs. According to the Air Transportation Association (ATA), fuel is an airline&rsquo;s second largest expense. With these prices falling their margins are increased substantially. <a href="http://www.capp.io/queries/new?query=dal">Here are some of solid fundamentals they are showing on their Cappio report</a></p>

<h2>Where are prices headed?</h2>

<p>The general consensus is that the current oil oversupply is economically unsustainable for producers who are not in the Gulf. These producers rely on shale, tar sands, and deep sea oil, which are much more expensive to produce. Eventually, they will need government intervention or will be squeezed out of their market share.</p>

<p>However, it’s impossible to time the market so accurately predicting where oil prices is impractical. OPEC, which produces about 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s crude oil, has been very passive about cutting supply to raise prices. There are claims that they won’t budge on supply if the price drops down to $40.</p>

<p>Luckily the world is no longer solely dependant on OPEC for oil. Russia, America and others are also huge players in the market that have influence on prices.
