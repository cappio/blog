  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&rsquo;s been a lot going on in March at Cappio HQ. Our primary focus this month was to find reliable and affordable data so we can continue to provide you with easy to read reports. We are very close to integrating with our new data source and should have updates in the next couple of weeks. This should solve some of the problems we have with stability and breadth of search.</p>

<p>In the meantime, it&rsquo;s been a while since we&rsquo;ve updated you on Cappio changes, here&rsquo;s a quick overview of some of our latest features:</p>

<h3>Rating Previews</h3>

<p>Cappio has always brought up critical competitor data in our &ldquo;Valuation&rdquo; module but the only way you could easily compare two companies holistically was to pull up both Cappio reports side-by-side. Now you can get a quick understanding by just taking a look at the &ldquo;Competitor&rdquo; module. We now cache all completed Cappio searches and have added the rating colors to previews of companies in the competitor module. Here&rsquo;s an example with our American Airline report:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Want to be rich? Lucky for you, <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-should-a-22-year-old-invest-his-her-money/answer/Ching-Ho">Ching Ho on Quora</a> laid out a roadmap for us - “a boring yet tried-and-true investment method that will make you rich over time, richer than most rappers who&rsquo;ll blow their money on cocaine&hellip;”</p>

<h4>How to Make 10 Million Dollars:</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/How-should-a-22-year-old-invest-his-her-money/answer/Ching-Ho"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KcaqfZf.png" width="250"></a></p>

<p>Despite the fact that his plan is optimistic, you could very well go ahead and follow it. However, if you read his whole post carefully, it’s clear his takeaway is that individuals need to invest in themselves. To build this kind of wealth, he made two key assumptions: you must have skills to earn your own income and learn to take control of your own finances.</p>

<p>I want to build on Ching Ho’s philosophy and argue that regardless of whether you want $10 million or just want to retire comfortably, you will need to start gathering financial acumen now.  With interest rates nearing all time lows, all that money sitting in your savings account is not doing anything for your long term wealth.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> My generation especially - lovingly lumped together as “millennials” - can no longer afford not to. Together we must cultivate a generation of investors.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Quick Investment Ideas for Busy People</h2>

<p>Welcome back to the second edition of CappioNotes. Just like last time, we will give you some quick starting points for potential investments. This week we are covering:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#ppc">Pilgrim&rsquo;s Pride</a></li>
<li><a href="#luv">Southwest Airlines</a></li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="ppc"></a>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Pride Corp (NASDAQ:PPC)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Great fundamentals with increasing cash flows and low debt.</li>
<li>Pilgrim’s Pride acquired Tyson Food‘s (TSN) Mexican poultry business for $400M. Expected to add $650M to annual revenues.</li>
<li>Paid a special cash dividend to shareholder of $5.77 a share. Shows confidence in future growth and shareholders.</li>
</ul>


<p>PPC isn’t typically regarded as the most exciting company to cover but their recent results say otherwise. Pilgrim’s pride is the second largest chicken producer in the world, having grown at an astronomical rate over the course of 2014. Their rock solid financials and continued efforts to grow make them a great investment for 2015.</p>

<h4>Rock solid fundamentals</h4>

<p>First and foremost, what makes PPC even worth considering is the financial stability it portrayed over the last year. Continually growing revenues, steady earnings growth, and excellent management of its debt levels helped the stock surge 131.08% over the past year. For the financially savvy out there, PPC’s debt-to-equity (a ratio of total liabilities to shareholder’s equity which indicates how to company is financing its assets) is very low at 0.25 and is currently below that of the industry average, implying that there has been very successful management of debt levels.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>We want to premiere the CappioNotes series as a way to jump start your own research by highlighting key insights we have gathered from reputable articles. Essentially, CappioNotes will be doing for qualitative analyst articles what our Cappio report does for quantitative financial data!</p>

<p>Today we are covering:</p>

<li><a href="#msft">Microsoft</a></li>
<li><a href="#gild">Gilead</a></li>
<li><a href="#dis">Disney</a></li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="msft"></a>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT): Taking the Cloud</h2>

<p>After their Surface’s big flop in 2012, Microsoft has been under the radar the last couple of years, working hard to rebrand themselves. However, they&rsquo;ve come back into investor&rsquo;s sights with the recent appointment of their new CEO, Satya Nadella, in February of 2014. They&rsquo;ve also have made headlines in 2014 with their acquisitions of Mojang, most known for their game Minecraft, and Nokia. Among investors, they are also known for it’s huge dividend yield of 2.8%, one of the best payouts in technology sector. Over the last year the company’s stock grew nearly 30% &ndash; Here’s why we think you should a look at Microsoft this year before it start rallying again:</p>

<h4>Refocused efforts in cloud</h4>

<p>Microsoft has really turned their focus towards mobile and cloud technologies in the last years.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> They have already shown great growth in 2014 based on their cloud revenue numbers. Commercial cloud revenue has grown 128% in last quarter alone.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> With Nadella leading the charge as a &ldquo;mobile first, cloud first&rdquo; company, there’s tremendous room for growth in 2015. This year, Microsoft is making a big push Microsoft’s mobile with lots of chat about what&rsquo;s to come of their Nokia aquisition.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><!-- Our best advice for anyone who asks that question is to stop and educate themselves before they throw away their money. These days, there are a ton of investment vehicles that are well suited for retail investors, such as ETFs, Index/Mutual Funds, and the more modern roboadvisors, like Wealthfront and Betterment. However, you want to retain control and understand where you money is going, stocks will always be a sensible choice. While  "stock picking" is inherently risky, there are many methods to reduce this risk and maximize your chances of growing your portfolio. -->


<p>One of the most frequent questions we get emailed is &ldquo;how does Cappio work?&rdquo; What powers Cappio is not some Wall Street wizardry, it&rsquo;s tried and true methodology using fundamental analysis. As a quick refresher, fundamental analysis is the process of researching a company based on what they do, how they make money, and it&rsquo;s financial data.</p>

<p>Usually this is a process that can take a couple hours, if not days for a novice. Luckily, an accounting professor by the name of Joseph Piotroski at the University of Chicago formalized many fundamental metrics that should be used when evaluating a company. We’ve added a few comparative metrics to the Cappio algorithm to make it more comphrensive and computational. Below is a video summarizing the methodology we will go over in this post:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You don’t need an economist to tell you oil prices are tanking. Anyone who’s visited the pump recently already has all the evidence they need. However, why oil prices are falling is a much more puzzling. Like any macroeconomic trend, the causes are a combination of political and legal factors. The Economist boils it down to four major factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Demand is low because of weak economic activity, increased efficiency, and movement towards oil alternatives.</li>
<li>Turmoil in Iraq and Libya, two big oil producers, has not affected their exporting.</li>
<li>America has become the world’s largest oil producer. Though it does not export crude oil, it now imports much less, creating a lot of spare supply.</li>
<li>The Saudis and their Gulf allies have decided not to sacrifice their own market share to restore the price. They can afford to do so since their margins are much higher than countries they detest such as Iran and Russia.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Do these current prices uncover investment opportunities?</h2>

<p>Let’s take a look at four fundamentally sound companies that relate to the current oil prices.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#glp">Global Partners LP</a></li>
<li><a href="#slb">Schlumberger Limited</a></li>
<li><a href="#xom">Exxon Mobil</a></li>
<li><a href="#dal">Delta Air Lines</a></li>
