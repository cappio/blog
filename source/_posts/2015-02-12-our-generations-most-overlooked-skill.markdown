Want to be rich? Lucky for you, [Ching Ho on Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-should-a-22-year-old-invest-his-her-money/answer/Ching-Ho) laid out a roadmap for us - “a boring yet tried-and-true investment method that will make you rich over time, richer than most rappers who'll blow their money on cocaine...”

####How to Make 10 Million Dollars:

Despite the fact that his plan is optimistic, you could very well go ahead and follow it. However, if you read his whole post carefully, it’s clear his takeaway is that individuals need to invest in themselves. To build this kind of wealth, he made two key assumptions: you must have skills to earn your own income and learn to take control of your own finances.

I want to build on Ching Ho’s philosophy and argue that regardless of whether you want $10 million or just want to retire comfortably, you will need to start gathering financial acumen now.  With interest rates nearing all time lows, all that money sitting in your savings account is not doing anything for your long term wealth.[^1] My generation especially - lovingly lumped together as “millennials” - can no longer afford not to. Together we must cultivate a generation of investors.

###How It Was

For my parents, retirement planning was simple: work at one company for 30 years and retire on a pension and social security. They may have held some other small investments, but for most, holding down a steady job with a solid pension created a nice retirement lifestyle. But today, we won’t be fortunate enough to enjoy our parents’ ideas of retirement, and we’ll instead face greater financial uncertainty in our golden years.

###The Disappearing Pensions

The era of the company pension has all but disappeared. Since 1998, the rate of Fortune 500 companies who offered pensions to new hires dropped from 60% to 24%. Now, only 7% of Fortune 500 employers offer new employees traditional pensions.[^2] These traditional pensions have static, defined payouts on retirement, based on the time and pay of the employee. To compensate, employers are moving towards 401(k) plans which is less risky for the company. This is because 401(k)s generally have variable returns based on employee investment choices. Regardless which retirement plan ends up better for employees, the trend is clear; individuals will now have to make thoughtful decisions on where their savings are placed.

Perhaps more importantly, even if pensions were still available, the average time a millennial stays at a job is 2-3 years: nowhere near enough to get a pension.[^3] This trend does not seem to be slowing down as the stigma of short employment is disappearing. This is a strong indicator that individuals will have to take on managing investments themselves.

###Live Long and Prosper?

A simple factor that is commonly overlooked is that the average millennial is going to live longer than their parents. While this may be great news, it leaves our generation entering the workforce with two options: __we either have to save more because our money will have to last longer, or we have to retire later.__

The problem is compounded with the crushing cost of education and healthcare. Even accounting for salary increases and inflation, these costs are continuing to rise at a frightening rate. Over the last 30 years, education costs have grown over 500% and health costs, nearly 300%.[^4] If you compare these numbers to the graph of inflation adjusted household income, it’s easy to see that this is a serious problem.

Don’t expect social security to bail anyone out either as it’s return is negligible for the middle class. It only pays out on average of $1,262/month, a rate which only rises ~10% (about $80 more per month) every year.[^5]

###What’s to Come

To summarize, this generation is in a period with rising costs and stagnant incomes. Companies are reducing pensions in favor of employee-managed 401(k)s. These are just two factors that show why the burden of investment will continue to shift towards individuals rather than employers. So with the odds looking like they are all stacked against us, what are we millennials to do? While Ching Ho’s *How to Make 10 Million Dollar* plan may have seemed a little overkill in the beginning of this post, I hope you have seen how important it is for us to start learning how to financially plan for our future. For our next post, I’ll explore some investment philosophies and strategies that our new generation of investors are adopting. Hope you'll join us!
