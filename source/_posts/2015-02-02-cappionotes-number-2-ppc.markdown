##Quick Investment Ideas for Busy People

Welcome back to the second edition of CappioNotes. Just like last time, we will give you some quick starting points for potential investments. This week we are covering:

* [Pilgrim's Pride](#ppc)
* [Southwest Airlines](#luv)

##<a name="ppc"></a>Pilgrim's Pride Corp (NASDAQ:PPC)

* Great fundamentals with increasing cash flows and low debt. 
* Pilgrim’s Pride acquired Tyson Food‘s (TSN) Mexican poultry business for $400M. Expected to add $650M to annual revenues. 
* Paid a special cash dividend to shareholder of $5.77 a share. Shows confidence in future growth and shareholders. 
	
PPC isn’t typically regarded as the most exciting company to cover but their recent results say otherwise. Pilgrim’s pride is the second largest chicken producer in the world, having grown at an astronomical rate over the course of 2014. Their rock solid financials and continued efforts to grow make them a great investment for 2015.

####Rock solid fundamentals 

First and foremost, what makes PPC even worth considering is the financial stability it portrayed over the last year. Continually growing revenues, steady earnings growth, and excellent management of its debt levels helped the stock surge 131.08% over the past year. For the financially savvy out there, PPC’s debt-to-equity (a ratio of total liabilities to shareholder’s equity which indicates how to company is financing its assets) is very low at 0.25 and is currently below that of the industry average, implying that there has been very successful management of debt levels.[^1]

####Poised for Grow in 2015

In efforts to keep up the substantial growth, PPC has acquired Tyson Foods, Inc.’s Mexican poultry business for $400 million dollars. The deal is expected to increase PPC’s revenues $650 million giving it a good boost on money coming in over the next year.[^2] The acquisition highlights PPC’s strategy to acquire vertically integrated companies to position itself in the industry for future growth. In addition, on January 28th, 2015, PPC paid out a special cash dividend of $5.77 a share to its shareholders as a testament to their financial discipline and confidence in the future.[^3] 

PPC’s positioning as a leader in the poultry production and distribution industry has given them a huge boost in 2014. With their continued efforts at aggressive expansion through acquisitions and dividend payouts, PPC is ready to keep rallying through 2015. And let’s be honest, who’s going to stop eating chicken anytime soon?

##<a name="luv"></a>Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV)

* Lower oil prices through 2015 will increase profitability for airline companies
* Southwest is now flying to more destinations 

With oil prices on a monumental dive through 2014, multiple investment opportunities opened up for 2015. One of the bigger ones that every investor should be taking advantage of right now is the airline industry. It’s been a well known fact that the airline industry’s profit margins have been miniscule due to high oil prices. Now that the costs have been drastically decreased, there’s nothing standing in the way of Southwest Airlines from generating some serious money. 

####Oil’s down, airlines are up

The rationale for taking advantage of airlines right now is pretty straightforward. Oil has always been the majority of an airline’s costs and now that it’s floating around $40 a barrel, airlines are going to be netting a lot more money than they have in the past. As a quick example, Southwest Airlines expects its fuel bill for 2015 to be $1.7 billion lower than in 2014. If they don’t change a thing, they’ll be astronomically more profitable due to the lower oil prices alone.[^1] That kind of profitability will drive stock prices higher through earnings releases. 

####Continuing the growth in 2015

The reason Southwest Airlines is the airline of choice for 2015 is due to its solid growth over the course of 2014 and expansion plan in 2015. First off, Southwest Airlines was the top performer in the S&P 500 in 2014 and that momentum isn’t going anywhere.[^5] Secondly, Southwest has started aggressively expanding its destination offerings by adding international and popular tourist destinations.[^6] With the oil expense cut by more than half along with the fact that people are flying more than ever, the potential for Southwest to increase earnings is immense.

Southwest is a prime example of the type of the investments people should look into making in 2015 as low oil prices have opened the door to sizable returns. Check out some detials on Southwest’s performance here:
