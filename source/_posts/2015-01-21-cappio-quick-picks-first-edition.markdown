So without further ado, let's jump right into it:

##Microsoft (NYSE:MSFT)
After their Surface’s big flop in 2012, Microsoft has been under the radar the last couple of years, working hard to rebrand themselves. However, they've come back into investor's sights with the recent appointment of their new CEO, Satya Nadella, in February of 2014. They've also have made headlines in 2014 with their acquisitions of Mojang, most known for their game Minecraft, and Nokia. Among investors, they are also known for it’s huge dividend yield of 2.8%, one of the best payouts in technology sector. Over the last year the company’s stock grew nearly 30% -- Here’s why we think you should a look at Microsoft this year before it start rallying again:

####Refocused efforts in cloud
Microsoft has really turned their focus towards mobile and cloud technologies in the last couple years[^1]. Microsoft has already shown great growth in 2014 based on their cloud revenue numbers. That business has doubled last quarter alone[2]. With Nadella leading the charge as a "mobile first, cloud first" company, there’s tremendous room for growth in 2015. This year, they are making In addition, Nadella is making a conscious effort to grow Microsoft’s mobile business as well as further the Xbox One’s standing in the gaming industry.[3]

####Cloud Computing industry as a whole is rapidly growing
The cloud computing industry is growing like wildfire, with global spending reaching $150 billion in 2014 [4]. There's no sign of that trend slowing down. An IHS report shows by 2017, enterprise spending on cloud computing will amount to a projected $235.1B [5]. Microsoft has positioned itself to compete with Amazon and Google to dominate this market. Revenue’s have increased over the last year and Microsoft has managed to accumulate a good amount of cash to acquire key players in cloud and mobile to grow its own service offerings. You can see from their aquisition history that 8 of the last 10 were related to cloud or mobile technologies. [6]

##Gilead Sciences (GILD): 
Gilead Sciences is an American biopharmaceutical company with a focus on developing and commercializing therapeutics. For more background info check the Gilead Wikipedia page. GILD makes top shelf treatments like Harvoni, a hepatitis C drug with a very high cure rate. It boasts a functional cure rate of 99% in select patient types. Harvoni has gotten lots of attention for both effectiveness and it’s price. Harvoni costs $1,125 a pill, or $94,500 for a 12-week course of treatment. It may seem outrageous but patients with hepatitis are still finding ways to pay for it.

Gilead has a long history of solid growth, but since it’s a biotech company, it’s stock price is pretty volatile. On an average day of holding GILD, you can expect to see price movement both upwards and downwards of 2-5%.  However, they are a solid company and always dominate their industry in fundamentals. Here are some reasons why 2015 looks great for them:

####Solid Projections and High Growth Potential
Gilead’s Q4 earnings will be out in the first week of February. We will see their hepatitis C drug, Harvoni, bring in solid sales and revenues. Analysts predict revenues of $6.7 billion overall and Earnings per Share of $2.23. This should be a very reachable number for Gilead. Gilead did over $2 for all of 2013. They have also crossed over estimates  for most of 2014. Gilead has constantly beaten earnings, and there is a strong possibility they will beat them once again. If they do, we expect a great jump in their stock price as other companies have had huge surges in recent months. 

In December, Gilead also announced that it has entered into an agreement with Osaka, a Japan based Ono Pharmaceutical company. Together they are working to develop and commercialize ONO-4059 to treat B-Cell Malignancies. ONO will develop the drug and Gilead will pay for exclusive rights. Gilead will have exclusive rights to this drug almost everywhere except ASEAN countries, i.e. Japan, China, Taiwan, and South Korea. 

####Booming pharmaceutical industry that doesn’t show signs of slowing
The pharmaceutical industry was incredibly successful this past year, reaching over $1 trillion in spending . Annual spending is expected to grow 5-7%, which is the highest pace since 2009. It is a high risk, high reward industry, due to a company’s success based on government regulation and FDA approval. The safest way to invest in this industry is to find companies that are extremely large, where one failed drug approval won’t cause the company to go bankrupt. Gilead is a prime example of this philosophy as it is extremely large and has great fundamentals.

##Disney (DIS):
If you’re looking for a blue chip stock with steady positive growth, Disney may fit your criteria. Their stock price is constantly breaking 52 week highs every quarter last year. This is because Disney has extremely [low mean reversion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reversion_(finance\)) and High Return on Equity. This makes Disney a great mid-long term hold that won’t make you anxious. The best time to get it is in the present moment, because their stock price rarely looks back. Some reasons why Disney deserves some research are:

####Highly anticipated releases in 2015 to follow positive reception in 2014
Their acquisition and growth of Marvel also shows how Disney capitalizes on opportunities. Big releases this year include a new Avengers movie, Ant-Man, and Star Wars. While it’s difficult to predict the performance in the box office, in 2014, Walt Disney Studios had 4 of the top 10 grossing movies. It’s also worth noting that ESPN, a Disney subsidiary, never fails to top TV ratings. 

####Investment in scientific research to keep spurring innovation and creativity
Disney growth engine is sparked with creativity and imagination. Imagination creates the movies, which make millions of dollars in the box office. However Disney has also invested in developing a world class research team that works on all sorts of scientific experiments. This research helps Disney to enter a variety of consumer industries beyond films. Check out the link below for some of the latest research projects the Disney Research team has ventured in:
