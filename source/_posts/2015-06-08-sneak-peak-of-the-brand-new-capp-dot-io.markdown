Jay, Chintan and I have dedicated the last year to learning as much as we can about financial analysis, retail investing, and the fintech industry. We are proud to have built a beautiful and easy way for thousands of individuals to do stock research. However, Capp.io can't stay a pet project we hacked together to scratch our own itch as naive investors. We are determined for Capp.io to become a product that investors really need and love using.

It's been five weeks since Team Capp.io moved from Atlanta to New York City for the DreamIt Accelerator. For the first half of the month, we turned every stone, collecting data and feedback from in-person meetings with NYC users, investors and DreamIt partners. This process forced us to take a hard look at the progress of the company and product from multiple perspectives.

We found that our most active users love Capp.io for it's quick quantitative analysis but still spend hours getting a deep understanding of their investments' businesses. While taking a look at a company’s financials and metrics is crucial, it’s only part of the equation. Taking a look at a company’s SEC filings and recent news is equally as important. We took this and other pieces of feedback to rethink Capp.io and take into account the whole research process. Here is a quick overview of how we plan to build a more complete solution.

###Deeper Insights

From the beginning of Capp.io, we’ve been keen on making sure we do a good job of boiling down all the financial data you would typically see, into easy to understand insights. So with the latest version of Capp.io, we wanted to make it as easy as reading a couple of sentences. On the new fundamental analysis report, Capp.io breaks down its analysis of each company into four sections and each of those sections now generate a small summary of what’s happening with the data inside:

These blurbs will point out important information and trends you should know like how much of a dividend the company pays or how the company’s metrics compare to its competitors. As always if you want dig deeper into the data, clicking on the sections will allow you to view the raw data.

###SEC Filings

We’ve partnered with TwoMargins to bring their amazing financial documents to our platform. While reading an SEC filing can seem daunting, it contains a lot vital information to help people understand the “why” behind the company’s fundamentals. Why is revenue growing? Why have the company’s operating expenses gone up? These are things that the management team directly answers in their 10-K or 10-Q reports. TwoMargin’s viewer allows users to add annotations directly onto the reports giving them the ability to find and understand important information in the filings.

###More Relevant and Featured News

Reading news and keeping up with current events gives a good investor his/her edge. We made sure that in the new version of Capp.io we gave our users access to the latest news not only on a company but also on its industry. Additionally, we want to make sure the most “relevant” content is displayed up front and center (big announcements acquisitions, earnings releases, etc.) so Capp.io lets users push content they think is more helpful to the top.
